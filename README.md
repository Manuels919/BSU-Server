# BSU-Server

During my time at Buffalo State University I was an assistant to one of the analysts in the Intsitututional Effectiveness and Planning department. She wanted to utitilize one the school's server to have a central place to store the data we working with. I created this script that allowed us to create tables in the database as needed and to upload the files that we static files we originally worked with.
